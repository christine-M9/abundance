      <h2>ABOUT Beatrice Bernstein</h2>

      <!-- Introduction -->
      <h3>Certified Life Coach</h3>
      <p>
        A Certified Life Coach, internationally recognized for helping people reach the highest health goals in all areas of life. 
        For over two decades, it is a great privilege to be able to celebrate with my clients as they accomplish the work to achieve all their amazing successes.
      </p>

      <!-- Certification -->
      <h3>Certified Mindvalley Holobody Coach </h3>
      <p>
        I earned my certification through Mindvalley as a Holobody Health Coach, and my clients often call me 
        <strong>“The Abundance Reset Coach.”</strong>
        Beatrice is greatful to have been trained as a certified Mindvalley Holobody Coach by the brilliant visionaries, Mindvalley Founder and CEO Viahrn Lakhiani, Co-founder of Mindvalley Coach, Ajit Nawalkha, and Mindvalley’s Mindvalley’s Head of Health & Fitness, Ronan Oliveira. 

She also feels privileged that her clients have come to affectionately call her their  “Abundance Reset Coach”, which led her to see herself in the same light and she looks forward to helping as many more people as possible to reach their utmost goals and to live life to its fullest when they too learn to attain their ultimate dreams of transformational success, heart-centered happiness and complete inner tranquility.
      </p>

      <!-- Leadership & Keynote -->
      <h3>Keynote Speaker & Founder</h3>
      <p>
        I am a transformational keynote speaker and had the privilege to speak at the annual conference of the International Association for Dance Medicine & Science in Basel, Switzerland and I am the proud founder of <strong> Healthy Young Dancer Project,</strong> a thriving 1.3K global community.  Recently, I am pleased to share that I was invited to joined the exciting team at <strong>Hearts Community Center</strong> as Head of Community Outreach Projects. I also draw upon my twenty years of life experience as a Wellbeing Coach, Professional Dancer and Actress, Special Needs Teacher, Mentor and Mother. Additionally, I have utilized my own inner healing powers to fully overcome all injuries and illness in my life, including healing my lung function, that at one point was down to only functioning at 50% from the trauma caused by COVID-19 and associated nerve damage and neuromuscular unction issues, alongside my brilliant holistic and medical healing team. Therefore, I truly believe that the power of love, and self-belief, in combination with supportive holistic nutrition, meditation and prayer and the healing power of functional movement, can enrich the lives of anyone who wants to recover and heal! I BELIEVE you can also overcome life's injuries, illnesses and mental challenges!
      </p>
